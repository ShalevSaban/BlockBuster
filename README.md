Backend server for movie rental management .  <br>
The server was developed in **Node.js** and Express. The architecture is divided into Business 
and Data Layers and is implemented by **REST** **API** calls with **CRUD**. <br>
The server manages a log File (using FS) and a Database in **MongoDB** which is accessed with Mongoose ODM.  <br>
The routers were secured with the use of JWT for authentication and authorization.  <br>
Automation tests were performed (unit and integration tests) and Features were built using TDD. <br>
Currently working on a client side using React.
